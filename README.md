# Snake-Game
Author: Marcin Czajka

    I've started this project to get a grasp of object oriented programming. I have used almost everything i know about c++ and now I hope this little game will serve as testimony to show that i have some basic knowledge about programming and show where I'm currently at. 
    I have written everything myself without looking at stackoverflow or similar sites for spoilers. Exception is a method for getting movement 
   input from player as I could not figure it out myself. I have mentioned original author near his part of the project along a link to his post.
